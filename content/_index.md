# Hello

I'm Jay, a developer from Mumbai. I like working and experimenting with web apps and large-scale systems. Currently, I'm excited about AI-based tooling for coding and exploring the extent to which it can amp up my workflow. I also love self-hosting things on both the cloud and my Beelink mini PC. I'm not the most fond of the American big tech and I'm trying to bring down my reliance on it. In my free time, I like tinkering with keyboards and watch a lot of movies. Here, I will write about tech while trying to keep all the fluff around it out. Getting down to the bare principles of modern web systems. I find most prominent voices in tech to be overly dogmatic and like to explore counter-mainstream ideas, even if I might disagree with them. I'm one of those people who believe that politics permeate every aspect of our lives, and a little political flavour always sneaks in in all my writings.




<!-- I hope my writings here are of a more interpersonal, reflective nature, much like a personal-yet-public diary rather than of an instructive kind. The last book I read: Maximum City. The last movie I saw: Polite Society. -->

Each of The White Lotus seasons is a parody until it isn't. It at least starts off as a scathing parody of a certain kind of people, but slowly transforms into something deeply reflective and sincere that makes you ask profound questions about self-identity to yourself. It starts out as "us" (the creators and the audience) relentlessly mocking "them" (clueless white people, mostly). But as the season progresses, it starts offering tender moments of both us and them realising how people are mere carriers of what has been passed onto them, and how they pass it onto others. How a person's characteristics almost always comes (and goes) in bunches. It almost manages to convince you that a even a good-hearted person, when tastes wealth, will turn into an asshole. At least from the outside. There is little one can do to separate the wealth and the assholeness. There is also commentary on how the ones without wealth are always on the lookout for wealth, and subconsciously the same assholeness, that they deride in the wealthy so much. And through these bunch of people the show manages to hold an overpowering mirror to the audience. It makes you ask, "am I really that much better than whoever I look down upon?" Are people's behaviours really a matter of choice and free will? Or are they merely a tool to rationalize whatever circumstances a person finds themselves in? -->
