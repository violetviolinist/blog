# Hello

I'm Jay, a developer from Mumbai. I like working and experimenting with web apps and large-scale systems. Currently, I'm excited about AI-based tooling for coding and exploring the extent to which it can amp up my workflow. I also love self-hosting things on both the cloud and my Beelink mini PC. I'm not the most fond of the American big tech and I'm trying to bring down my reliance on it. In my free time, I like tinkering with keyboards and watch a lot of movies. I will write here about tech, movies, and other things. I hope my writings here are of a more interpersonal, reflective nature, much like a personal-yet-public diary rather than of an instructive kind. The last book I read: Maximum City. The last movie I saw: Polite Society.
