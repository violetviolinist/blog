# Technical Context: Hugo FTP Theme

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies

1. **Hugo:** Static site generator (version 0.80.0 or higher recommended)
   - Leverages Hugo's templating system
   - Uses Hugo's content organization and front matter
   - Relies on Hugo's built-in functions for metadata and navigation

2. **HTML5:** For semantic structure and accessibility
   - Uses appropriate HTML elements for content structure
   - Implements accessible navigation patterns

3. **CSS3:** For styling the FTP-like interface
   - Minimal use of advanced features to maintain the simple FTP aesthetic
   - Responsive design principles for various screen sizes

### Optional Dependencies

1. **Font Awesome (optional):** Could be used for directory and file icons
   - Alternative: Unicode characters (üìÅ, üìÑ) or simple CSS-based icons

## Development Setup

### Local Development Requirements

1. **Hugo Installation:** Required for local development and testing
   - Installation guide: https://gohugo.io/installation/
   - Command line interface used for site generation and server

2. **Text Editor/IDE:** Any text editor with HTML/CSS support
   - Recommended: Visual Studio Code with Hugo extension

3. **Web Browser:** For testing and previewing the theme
   - Chrome/Firefox/Safari with developer tools for debugging

### Development Workflow

1. **Theme Development:**
   - Edit theme files in `themes/hugo-ftp/`
   - Run Hugo server with `hugo server -D` for live preview
   - Test with sample content to ensure proper rendering

2. **Content Creation:**
   - Create Markdown files in the `content/` directory
   - Use front matter for metadata (title, date, lastmod)
   - Organize content in directories to match desired site structure

## Technical Constraints

1. **Hugo Compatibility:**
   - Theme should work with current Hugo versions
   - Avoid deprecated Hugo features

2. **Browser Compatibility:**
   - Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Graceful degradation for older browsers

3. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Minimize CSS file size
   - Optimize for fast loading times
   - Avoid unnecessary JavaScript

## Deployment

The theme is designed to work with any standard Hugo deployment method:

1. **Static Hosting:** GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.
2. **Self-Hosted:** Apache, Nginx, or any web server capable of serving static files

No special server-side requirements beyond standard static file hosting.
