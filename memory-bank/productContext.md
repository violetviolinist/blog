# Product Context: Hugo FTP Theme

## Purpose

The `hugo-ftp` theme serves as a unique, nostalgic interface for a personal blog website. By mimicking the visual style and navigation of a classic FTP server, it provides:

1. A distinctive, minimalist aesthetic that stands out from typical blog designs
2. An intuitive hierarchical navigation system that organizes content in a familiar directory/file structure
3. A technical, "hacker-like" feel that may appeal to tech-oriented audiences

## User Experience Goals

1. **Intuitive Navigation:** Users should easily understand the hierarchical structure of content through the FTP-like interface.
2. **Clear Information Display:** Content listings should provide useful metadata (publish date, update date, size) in an organized, scannable format.
3. **Focused Reading Experience:** Once a user navigates to a post, the reading experience should be clean and distraction-free.
4. **Nostalgic Appeal:** The theme should evoke the feeling of browsing an FTP server while maintaining modern usability standards.

## Target Audience

Primary users will likely be:
- Tech-savvy individuals who appreciate the nostalgic FTP interface
- Readers of the blog who value content organization and clear navigation
- Other Hugo users who might adopt the theme for their own sites

## Content Structure

The theme supports a hierarchical content organization:
- Homepage (`~/`): Lists top-level sections and files, with introductory content below
- Sections (`~/section/`): Lists subsections and posts within that section
- Posts (`~/section/subsection/post-title`): Displays the full content of a blog post

This structure allows for logical organization of content by topic, category, or any other classification system the site owner chooses to implement.
