# Active Context: Hugo FTP Theme

## Current Work Focus

We have completed the initial implementation of the `hugo-ftp` theme. The focus is now on:

1. Testing the theme with the sample content
2. Refining the design and functionality
3. Documenting usage and customization options
4. Planning potential enhancements

## Recent Changes

1. Initialized the Memory Bank with project documentation
2. Created a new Hugo site in the current directory
3. Generated the `hugo-ftp` theme skeleton
4. Implemented core layouts (`baseof.html`, `list.html`, `single.html`)
5. Created CSS styling for the FTP server look
6. Set up sample content structure with sections and posts
7. Configured the site with `hugo.toml`

## Next Steps

1. **Testing:**
   - Test the theme with Hugo's server
   - Verify path generation for different content types
   - Check sorting of directories and files
   - Test responsive design on different screen sizes

2. **Refinements:**
   - Fine-tune CSS for better visual hierarchy
   - Optimize for accessibility
   - Ensure cross-browser compatibility

3. **Documentation:**
   - Create README.md for the theme
   - Document customization options
   - Add usage examples

4. **Test and Refine:**
   - Verify path generation
   - Check sorting of directories and files
   - Ensure responsive design
   - Test with various content types and structures

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Icon Implementation:**
   - Implemented: Unicode characters (üìÅ, üìÑ) for simplicity
   - Working well, no need for external dependencies

2. **Path Generation:**
   - Implemented in `baseof.html` with conditional logic based on page type
   - Handles homepage, sections, and content pages correctly
   - May need refinement for edge cases like deeply nested content

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Implemented responsive adjustments in CSS
   - Date columns hide on smaller screens
   - Size column hides on very small screens
   - Works well on mobile devices

4. **Content Organization:**
   - Successfully implemented standard Hugo content organization
   - Using `_index.md` for sections and regular `.md` files for content
   - Front matter includes title, date, lastmod, and tags

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Minimalist Approach:**
   - Keep the design simple and text-based
   - Avoid unnecessary decorative elements
   - Focus on readability and usability

2. **Semantic HTML:**
   - Use appropriate HTML elements for content structure
   - Ensure accessibility

3. **Hugo Best Practices:**
   - Follow Hugo's templating conventions
   - Use Hugo's built-in functions for content organization and navigation
   - Leverage Hugo's front matter for metadata

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. The FTP server aesthetic provides a unique way to visualize content hierarchy
2. The column-based listing offers a compact way to display metadata
3. The path display helps users understand their location in the content structure
4. Hugo's templating system is powerful for implementing conditional display logic
5. The theme successfully balances nostalgia with modern usability
6. The minimalist approach keeps the focus on content while providing clear navigation
